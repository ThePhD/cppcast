Dr. Colin Hirsch studied Computer Science at the University of Technology in Aachen, Germany in 1993 and later got a PhD in Mathematics from the same university. He worked for two years as a consultant for T-Mobile, developing back-end server applications in C++ and Lua. Later Colin moved to Italy, opened his own business and continued working for T-Mobile (now Deutsche Telekom) as well as working for some other interesting projects like Greenpeace and the Austrian ministry of ecology.

In his free time he enjoys photography, being in nature, science fiction and spending time with his daughter.
