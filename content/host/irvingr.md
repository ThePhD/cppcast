Rob Irving is a Senior Software Engineer and Development Team Lead with [PAR Government](http://www.pargovernment.com/) in Cary, NC. He is a polyglot with experience in C#, Objective-C, Java and Ruby but the majority of his time and expertise is in C++. He started the CppCast podcast in February 2015, frustrated by the lack of podcast content for C++ development.

A believer in continuous education, he loves learning about new technologies, often through podcasts!
