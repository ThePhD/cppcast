Saar Raz is a tech and C++ enthusiast from Israel, Saar programs in C++ mostly in his free time. In late 2017, he volunteered to implement C++20 Concepts in the Clang compiler, and has been working on that since, now in the process of merging the work into mainline clang.
Other than C++ and tech, Saar also likes graphic design and playing video games.
