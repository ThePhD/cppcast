Oliver has been a C++ hater since 2008 - fortunately, that all changed with C++11 and he's firmly an enthusiast now. He's spent his time doing everything from embedded devices to network engineering and now Internet security related endeavours. He's a big proponent of writing software in a style driven by some form of testing and its place in pushing you towards well-architected, maintainable code. In his spare time he also co-organises C++ London Uni which provides free lessons for people wanting to get into developing C++ and the wider ecosystem around it.
