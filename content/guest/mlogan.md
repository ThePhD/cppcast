Mark started learning C++ with Borland Turbo C++ in high school, so that he could build video games. After 20 years, he's finally starting to feel like he knows what he's doing. After graduating from Northeastern University's College of Computer Science, Mark spent 7 years at Google, mainly working on internal infrastructure and automation. More recently, he returned to his first love - game programming - and helped found a studio called Artillery. He's currently the tech lead on Artillery's free-to-play RTS, code-named Atlas. He spends his time working on performance optimization, networking, and solving cross-platform development problems.
