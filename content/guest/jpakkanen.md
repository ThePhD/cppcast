Jussi Pakkanen is the original creator and project lead of the Meson build system. This has lead to many interesting things such as people coming up to him at conferences to compete in who has the most terrible build system setup inside their corporate walls. His prior work experience has ranged from desktop Linux to mail sorting, mobile development, slot machines and computer security. His hobbies at the time of writing include sitting at home waiting for the corona virus lockdown procedures to end.
