Anders is here as the author of cppquiz.org. He's been working as a programmer since 2001, in fields ranging from multiphase flow simulations to web development. He’s been doing everything from working on compilers to being CTO, and has been using a wide variety of languages. C++ is closest to his heart, but he’s been doing other things for the last five years. He’s very happy to be back as a C++ developer from October 1, in his new job at Zivid Labs. Anders is also a father of two, and in his spare time he’s the producer and frontman of the futurepop band Modulo One.
