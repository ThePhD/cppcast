Born in 1988 in Dresden, I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and  Master's Degree in Microsystems & Microelectronics. Fell in Love with C++ while working with embedded systems. Klemens was working full time as a C++-Developer from 2013 until early 2016, and is now starting his own consulting company, trying to bring C++ to C-Programmers.
