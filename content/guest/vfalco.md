Vinnie Falco started programming on an Apple II+ in 1982. He did significant work on Canvas, an early 1990s desktop publishing program that starting on the Macintosh. A while later he wrote BearShare - a Gnutella compatible file sharing program.
After that Vinnie joined up with Ripple, a company that is developing a global financial settlement network built on top of a decentralized cryptocurrency and its associated ledger. Ripple has graciously given him the opportunity to develop and publish Beast, the HTTP and WebSocket library written in C++ and used in Ripple.
