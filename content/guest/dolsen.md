David’s first job out of college in 1993 was working for several years on the front end of the Rational Software C++ compiler.  Then he didn’t touch C++ at all for a couple decades, instead programming mostly in Java and C#, working on various software development tools and mobile apps.  For the last four years, David has been the lead developer on the PGI C++ compiler, recently renamed to the NVIDIA HPC C++ compiler.  He has been a member of the ISO C++ Standards Committee since November 2018.
