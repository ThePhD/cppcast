Botond Ballo is a software engineer at Mozilla, where he has been working on the Firefox web browser's rendering engine for 6 years. He's been attending C++ standards meetings for about the same time, and blogging about them to keep the C++ user community informed about standardization progress. In the committee, his interests include general language evolution, reflection, and tooling. Botond likes to hack on IDEs and other developer tools in his spare time. Offline, you might spot him climbing rocks or reading fantasy novels.
