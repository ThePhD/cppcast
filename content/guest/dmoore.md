Dave Moore started programming after getting fired from his college work study job. This worried his parents, but it seems to have worked out in the end. After spending 17 years in and around the computer games industry, most recently at RAD Game Tools, he's now a software engineer at Oculus Research, working to advance the computer vision technology underlying virtual and augmented reality.
