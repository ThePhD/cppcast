Tony Wasserka is a freelance software developer based in Berlin, Germany. He works on low-level software like operating systems (kernels and drivers alike) and firmware for embedded systems. His main interest is using strong type-safety and zero-cost abstractions to write software for resource-constrained and timing-sensitive applications with good performance with better robustness and correctness than with other approaches. His tool of choice for this is usually C++, with Rust being an increasingly viable alternative.
