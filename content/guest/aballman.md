Aaron has been a professional software developer for just under 20 years, most of which has been spent working on compilers of some sort. He currently works as a Sr Staff Compiler Engineer at Intel and most of his compiler experience is from working on Clang. Aaron is the code owner for a few things in the Clang community (attributes, clang-query) and primarily focuses on the compiler frontend. He's been a member of the C++ committee for about 7.5 years and of the C committee for a little over 4 years. He has a personal interest in getting involved in committee work around security and safety -- he wants to find ways to make it harder for programmers to write bugs in the first place and make it easier for tools to tell programmers about the bugs they've written.
