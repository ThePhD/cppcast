Tony Van Eerd has been coding for well over 25 years, and hopefully coding well for some of that. Mostly in graphics/video/film/broadcast (at Inscriber & Adobe), writing low level pixel++, high level UI, threading, and everything else. He now enables painting with light at Christie Digital. He is on the C++ Committee. He is a Ninja and a Jedi.
