Björn works for Net Insight, where he wears many hats, including mentor trainer, troubleshooter, networking protocol designer, software architect, and programmer, and he is continuously pushing the codebase to increasingly modern C++. Programming has been his full-time profession since graduating from University in 1994, mostly writing embedded software for networking equipment. Björn first experienced programming when home computers be came popular in the early 80s, and it quickly became a permanent interest of his.

Occasionally Björn has been seen tinkering with unorthodox software constructs, pondering "what can be done with this?" He lives in Stockholm.
