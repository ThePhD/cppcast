Vadims adventures in programming started with Basic on a 8 bit micro-computer with whopping 4KB of RAM when he was 10 year old in the mid-80s and continued with Pascal, C and, at the beginning of the 90s, discovery of C++, that he has been using since then. What started as a hobby, became a job when, after finishing PhD in mathematical physics in 2002, Vadim founded TT-Solutions company providing support for open source software and, in particular, wxWidgets. Almost 20 years, one marriage and three children later, Vadim still remains enthusiastic about programming in general and open source in particular and tries to contribute to other open source projects whenever possible, even if his primary focus remains on wxWidgets.
