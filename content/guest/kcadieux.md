Kevin is an engineer on the MSVC back-end team, working on code generation, optimization, and build throughput. He is the designer and main implementer of C++ Build Insights, the new build analysis platform for the MSVC toolchain. In his spare time he... wait, what spare time? Anyway, he likes to play video games sometimes, and enjoys creative endeavors such as graphic design and writing.
