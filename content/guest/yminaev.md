Yuri is working in the PVS-Studio company as one of developers of the C++ static analyzer.
His primary responsibility is to keep low-level stuff in order and add new features to the core module.
It's been almost 2 years since he joined the team after about 12 years of IT experience.
Apart from that, he periodically gives talks at various conferences - mainly on topics related to static analysis and C++.
On his spare time, Yuri likes to program in C++, play some guitar, and sometimes hike around aimlessly.
