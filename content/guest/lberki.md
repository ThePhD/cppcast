After a number of diverse jobs with computers including Linux system administration and GPS navigation devices, Lukács has been working at Google in the Bazel team since 2009; in this decade, he has worked on almost every part of it: integration with remote execution, Android builds, its internal dependency management framework, internal telemetry, support for various programming languages and a lot more. He played a significant role in creating Bazel from Blaze, its Google-internal predecessor.
