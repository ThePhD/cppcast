Tyler Ang-Wanek has been developing software professionally for the past 3.5 years. He works as a senior developer at Axosoft, on the GitKraken team. His work primarily shifts among developing native node modules for use in GitKraken, architectural work for code and APIs around GitKraken, and developing new features for GitKraken. He is the creator of the node module Node Sentinel File Watcher (NSFW), a native file watcher written for GitKraken that has made its way into Atom and VSCode. One of his major accomplishments includes taking leadership of the open source native node module NodeGit. After much hard work on the NodeGit repo and within the community, Tyler joined the leadership group for LibGit2.
