Jeri Janet Ellsworth is an American entrepreneur and an autodidact computer chip designer and inventor. She gained fame in 2004 for creating a complete Commodore 64 system on a chip housed within a joystick, called C64 Direct-to-TV. That "computer in a joystick" runs 30 video games from the early 1980s, and at peak, sold over 70,000 units in a single day via the QVC shopping channel.
In September 2019 Jeri Ellsworth initiated a Kickstarter for a new device based on the same principles of the castAR, called Tilt Five.
