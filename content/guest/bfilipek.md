Bartłomiej Filipek (Bartek as a shorter version) is a C++ software developer at Xara where he works mostly on text features for advanced document editors. He works remotely from Cracow/Poland. 
Apart from graphics applications, Bartek also has experience with game development, large-scale systems for aviation, writing graphics drivers and even biofeedback.
For seven years Bartek has been regularly blogging. In the early days the topic revolved around graphics programming, and now he focuses on Core C++. 
In his spare time, he loves assembling trains and Lego with his little son. And he's a collector of large Lego Star Wars models.
