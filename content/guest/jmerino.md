Julio has been interested in build systems since the early 2000s. Such interest started with frustrations over autoconf and automake, and followed with amazement by what NetBSD and pkgsrc could achieve with a monorepo and a build system specially tailored to it. These adventures were continued with his own (now-dead) build system (http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/), his own testing framework (https://github.com/jmmv/kyua), and his latter joining the Bazel team in 2016. Julio has been at Google for 11+ years and is about to embark on some new challenges.
