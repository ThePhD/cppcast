Jules has been developing audio and library software in C++ for over 15 years, and is the author of the JUCE library, the most widely used framework for audio applications and plugins. Music tech company ROLI acquired JUCE in 2014, and as well as continuing work on library itself, he helps to guide ROLI's other software projects.

He also created the Tracktion audio workstation in 2002, which is still going strong and being used by thousands of recording musicians around the world.

He lives in London, and likes to escape from the world of music technology by playing classical guitar
