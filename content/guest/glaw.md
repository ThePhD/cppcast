Greg is the co-founder and CEO of Undo. He is a coder at heart, but likes to bridge the gap between the business and software worlds. (Sadly, these days most of Greg's coding is done on aeroplanes.)

Greg has 20 yearsâ€™ experience in the software industry and has held development and management roles at companies including the pioneering British computer firm Acorn, as well as fast-growing start ups, NexWave and Solarflare. It was at Acorn that Greg met Julian and on evenings and weekends, they invented the core technology that would eventually become UndoDB. Greg left Solarflare in 2012 to lead Undo as CEO and has overseen the company as it transitioned from the shed in his back garden to a scalable award-winning business.

Greg holds a PhD from City University, London, that was nominated for the 2001 British Computer Society Distinguished Dissertation Award. He lives in Cambridge, UK with his wife and two children and in his spare time, catches up on email.
