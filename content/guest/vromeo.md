Vittorio Romeo is an undergraduate Computer Science student at "Universit√† degli Studi di Messina".
Since childhood he has always been interested in programming, and learned to develop applications and games as an autodidact.
After discovering C++ a few years ago, Vittorio became extremely passionate about its evolution and its community.
He currently works on open-source general-purpose C++14 libraries and develops free open-source games.
Vittorio also loves teaching: he manages a well-received C++11/C++14 video tutorial series and he talked about game development in C++ at CppCon 2014.
When he's not in front of a computer, Vittorio enjoys fitness activities (weightlifting, swimming, running) and reading.
