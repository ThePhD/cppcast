Vittorio Romeo has been a Software Engineer at Bloomberg for more than 3 years, working on mission-critical company C++ infrastructure and providing Modern C++ training to hundreds of fellow employees.

He began programming around the age of 8 and quickly became a C++ enthusiast. Vittorio created several open-source C++ libraries and games, published many video courses and tutorials, and actively participates in the ISO C++ standardization process.

He is also an active member of the C++ community and has an ardent desire to share his knowledge and learn from others. When heâ€™s not writing code, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities, competitive/challenging computer gaming and sci-fi movies/TV-series.
