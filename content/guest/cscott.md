Craig is a CMake co-maintainer and author of the book ["Professional CMake: A Practical Guide"](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/). He has been developing cross-platform C++ software since 2001, targeting most major platforms and working on large scale frameworks, scientific algorithm development, Qt GUI applications, backend services and embedded devices. He has been fortunate enough to work in a range of settings including government research, consumer electronics, mid-size enterprise and a startup. He derives unreasonable levels of satisfaction from automating software build and CI processes, making them more efficient, more robust and easier for developers to use.
