Titus is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google, where he has worked since 2010. Today, he is the chair of the subcommittee for the design of the C++ standard library. At Google, he is the library lead for Google’s C++ codebase: 250 million lines of code that will be edited by 12K distinct engineers in a month. For the last 9 years, Titus and his teams have been organizing, maintaining, and evolving the foundational components of Google’s C++ codebase using modern automation and tooling. Along the way he has started several Google projects that are believed to be in the top 10 largest refactorings in human history.

As a direct result of helping to build out refactoring tooling and automation, Titus has encountered first-hand a huge swath of the shortcuts that engineers and programmers may take to “just get something working”. That unique scale and perspective has informed all of his thinking on the care and feeding of software systems. His most recent project is the book “Software Engineering at Google”, to be published by O’Reilly in late 2019/early 2020.
