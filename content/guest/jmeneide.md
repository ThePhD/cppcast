JeanHeyd "ThePhD" is a student at Columbia University in New York. Most of their programming is for fun and as a hobby, even if their largest open-source contribution -- sol2 -- is used across many industries. They are currently working towards earning their own nickname, climbing the academic ladder while spending as much time as possible contributing to C++ standardization and development. Their newest and biggest project is Unicode for C++.

They very much love dogs and hopes to have their own in a year or so. They also like TWRP's "Feels Pretty Good" from the album Together Through Time.
