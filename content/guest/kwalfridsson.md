Krister got introduced to low-level programming by the C64/Amiga demo scene in the 80s. This led to an interest in operating systems and compilers, and he has been involved in the NetBSD and GCC projects for more than 20 years. His career has been split between OS-level development on embedded platforms and compiler development, and he most enjoys working with "strange" custom-made architectures.
