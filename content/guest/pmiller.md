Paul is a partner and lead engineer at Digital Film Tools/Silhouette FX. He has been writing visual effects and image processing software for over 20 years, and has been using C++ for most of that time. He started his love of graphics and digital music on the Amiga in 1986, teaching himself C with K&R and the Amiga ROM Kernel manuals. In 1992 he ended up Wisconsin, writing software for the relatively new digital post production industry on Silicon Graphics workstations, and has been writing widely-used tools for that industry since. He uses Qt for cross-platform UI, Python, OpenGL, and OpenCL extensively.

He holds a private pilot's license and enjoys going to movies and beer festivals.
