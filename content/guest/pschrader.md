Phil started working in consulting primarily as a C programmer. Very quickly he found himself being tempted by the famous "object-oriented" programming language called C++.
He started volunteering at a local high-school robotics program where they used C++ to make their robots competitive.
Hooked on C++ he found Peloton Technology where he had the chance to learn and explore what C++ is capable of. He's still exploring :)
