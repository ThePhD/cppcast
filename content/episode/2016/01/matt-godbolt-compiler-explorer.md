Matt is a developer at trading firm DRW.  Before that he's worked at Google, run a C++ tools company, and spent over a decade in the games industry making PC and console games.  He is fascinated by performance and created GCC Explorer, to help understand how C++ code ends up looking to the processor.  When not performance tuning C++ code he enjoys writing emulators for 8-bit computers in Javascript.
