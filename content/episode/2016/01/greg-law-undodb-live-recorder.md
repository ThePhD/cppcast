Dr Greg Law is co-founder and CEO at Undo Software. He has spent nearly 20 years writing systems-level code, including novel kernel designs and networking architectures in academia and at a variety of start-ups. Greg finds it particularly rewarding to turn innovative software technology into “real” business development.  He still gets to write some code, although sadly most of his coding these days is done on aeroplanes. Greg lives in Cambridge, England with his wife and two children.
