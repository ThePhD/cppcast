Herb Sutter is a leading authority on software development. He is the best selling author of several books including Exceptional C++ and C++ Coding Standards, as well as hundreds of technical papers and articles, including the essay “The Free Lunch Is Over” which coined the term “concurrency revolution” and its recent sequel “Welcome to the Jungle” on the end of Moore’s Law and the turn to mainstream heterogeneous supercomputing from the cloud to ‘smartphones.’
