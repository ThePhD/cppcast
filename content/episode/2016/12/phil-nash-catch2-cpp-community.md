Phil started coding back in the early 80s, on 8-bit home computers: from the ZX-81 to the Commodore 64, in BASIC and assembler. He later moved on to PCs and C++ in the early 90s and, despite forays into other languages, keeps coming back to C++. His career has taken him through domains such as anti-virus, mobile, finance and developer tools - among others. He's the original author of the C++ test framework, Catch and is now Developer Advocate at JetBrains for CLion, AppCode and ReSharper C++. His hobbies include writing podcast bios and trolling the podcast hosts.
