Stephen Kelly first encountered CMake through working on KDE and like many C++ developers, did his best to ignore the buildsystem completely. That worked well for 4 years until 2011 when the modularization of KDE libraries led to a desire to simplify and upstream as much as possible to Qt and CMake. Since then, Stephen has been responsible for many core features and designs of 'Modern CMake' and now tries to lead designs for its future.
