Jeff is a Visualization Software Engineer at Intel, where he works on the open source OSPRay project. He enjoys all things ray tracing, high performance computing,  clearly implemented code, and the perfect combination of Git/CMake/modern C++. Prior to joining Intel, Jeff was an HPC software engineer at SURVICE Engineering where he worked on interactive ballistic simulation applications for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, implemented using C++, CUDA, and Qt. When he is able, Jeff enjoys  academic research in ray tracing and high performance computing, with a specific interest in multi-hit ray tracing algorithms and applications for both graphics 3D rendering and ray-based simulations.

In his spare time, Jeff enjoys powerlifting, golf, being an electric guitar nerd, and studying a wide spectrum of music ranging from progressive metal to ambient electronic music.
