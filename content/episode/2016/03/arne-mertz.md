Arne is a Software Engineer at ZÃ¼hlke Engineering, a blogger and a clean code enthusiast.
He has been maintaining and developing large financial C++ applications for several years.
Arne has a diploma in physics and has written some scientific code for his degree courses in Fortran77 and C++ before he started his programming career.
Currently he is broadening his view on the software development world by doing test automation, integration, 
requirements engineering and tooling for a large Java/JavaScript web application.
