Bryce Adelstein Lelbach is a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), a US Department of Energy research facility. Working alongside a team of mathematicians and physicists, he develops and analyzes new parallel programming models for exascale and post-Moore architectures. Bryce is one of the developers of the HPX C++ runtime system; he spent five years working on HPX while he was at Louisiana State University's Center for Computation and Technology. He also helped start the LLVMLinux initiative, and has occasionally contributed to the Boost C++ libraries. Bryce is an organizer for C++Now and CppCon conferences and he is passionate about C++ community development. He serves as LBNL's representative to the C++ standards committee.
