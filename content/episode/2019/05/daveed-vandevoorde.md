David ("Daveed") Vandevoorde is a Belgian computer scientist who lives near Princeton, NJ, USA. He is vice-president of engineering at the Edison Design Group (EDG), where he contributes primarily to the implementation of their C++ compiler front end. He is an active member of the C++ standardization committee where he is primarily active in the core language evolution work. His recent work in that context has primarily been about extending the capabilities of “constexpr evaluation”. Daveed is also one of the five members of the committee’s “direction group”. He is the primary author of the well-regarded “C++ Templates: A Complete Guide” (now available in its second edition).
