Michal is 34 years old and started programming when he was 11. C (and C++ soon after) became his favorite language soon afterwards.
After quitting University after 2 years he was a regular programmer in a company for 4 years. He then started his own computer game project, which he's been working on for 7 years already. The game is much more successful than anticipated (with more than 1.7 million sales) while still in early access. We are close to finishing the game and deciding what to do next.
