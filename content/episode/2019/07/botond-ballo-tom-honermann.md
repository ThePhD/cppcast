Botond Ballo is a software engineer at Mozilla, where he has been working on the Firefox web browser's rendering engine for 6 years. He's been attending C++ standards meetings for about the same time, and blogging about them to keep the C++ user community informed about standardization progress. In the committee, his interests include general language evolution, reflection, and tooling. Botond likes to hack on IDEs and other developer tools in his spare time. Offline, you might spot him climbing rocks or reading fantasy novels.

Tom Honermann is a software engineer at Synopsys where he has been working on the Coverity static analyzer for the past 8 years.  His first C++ standard committee meeting was Lenexa in 2015.  He currently chairs the SG16 text and Unicode study group and participates in the SG2 modules, SG13 HMI/IO, and SG15 tooling study groups.  His contributions to C++20 include the new char8_t builtin type.  A C++ minion with 20 years professional experience.  Husband and father of two awesome boys.
