Clare is an independent consultant, helping teams streamline their work with legacy and hard-to-test C++ and Qt code.

She has worked in software development for over 30 years, and in C++ for 20 years.

Since 2017, she has used her spare time to work remotely with Llewellyn Falco on [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp), to radically simplify testing of legacy code. She has enjoyed this so much that she recently went independent, to focus even more on helping others to work more easily with legacy code.
    
Clare was until recently a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. She is the original author of their popular 3D crystal structure visualisation program [Mercury](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/mercury/).
