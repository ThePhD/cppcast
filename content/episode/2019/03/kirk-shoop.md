Kirk stumbled into an internship at Microsoft in the 90s that turned into contracting and eventually employment at Microsoft. At Microsoft Kirk sometimes pushed the compiler to its knees in the pursuit of libraries that prevent common errors. In 2013 Kirk joined Microsoft Open Technologies Inc to work on open source. Kirk began investing heavily in rxcpp in the belief that it is a better abstraction for async than the primitives commonly used. Now Kirk works at Facebook with Eric Niebler and Lewis Baker to build async range concepts and algorithms (with coroutines) into the c++ std library.
