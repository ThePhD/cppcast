Björn Fahller is a senior developer at Net Insight, and has been developing software for a living since 1994, mostly embedded programming for communications devices.  Björn learned C++ from usenet and the ARM (Annotated Reference Manual) which was the standard before there was a standard. On a hobby basis, Björn likes to find silly solutions to non-problems and to explore effects of programming constructs.
 
Outside of programming, Björn is a member of a small group thet brews beer together, and is also a member of a volunteer organization of aviators who help  with things like search and rescue operations, forest fire monitoring, and storm damage assessment.
