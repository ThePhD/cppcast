Peter Bindels is a C++ software engineer who prides himself on writing code that is easy to use, easy to work with and well-readable to anybody familiar with the language. He's worked for a contractor for a few years and then made the switch to work at Tomtom, where he's been working on various parts of the software chain, last of which was a major cleanup in the navigation code base. In doing so he developed a tool to determine, check and improve dependencies between components, which allows quicker structural insight in complicated systems. He also created HippoMocks in 2008, one of the first full fledged C++ mocking frameworks that is still a relevant choice today. He has given two talks at Meeting C++ 2016 and will be giving his third talk, on Mocking in C++, at CppNow 2017.
