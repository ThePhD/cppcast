Adi is an entrepreneur, speaker, consultant, software architect and a computer vision and machine learning expert with an emphasis on real-time applications. He specializes in building cross-platform, high-performance software combined with high production quality and maintainable code-bases. Adi is the founder of the Core C++ users group in Israel.  
Having worked on proprietary software for most of his career, his most visible contribution to the world of open-source software is, somewhat ironically, the design of the OpenCV logo.
