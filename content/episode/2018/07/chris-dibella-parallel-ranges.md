Christopher Di Bella is a Staff Software Engineer for Codeplay’s ComputeCpp Runtime Technology and a C++ teacher. He advocates for including the Concepts TS and the Ranges TS in C++20.

Chris spends his days working on ComputeCpp, Codeplay’s implementation of SYCL, a Khronos Standard for heterogeneous programming in C++; the Khronos implementation for the Parallel STL (using SYCL); and researching Parallel Ranges, which is an attempt to fuse ranges together with the parallel STL.

Chris was previously a software developer for Nasdaq, and a tutor for UNSW Sydney’s advanced C++ and compiler courses. In his spare time, Chris enjoys poking at things involving Ranges, snowboarding, playing games, and watching films.
