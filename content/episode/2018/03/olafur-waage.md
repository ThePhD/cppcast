Ólafur Waage is a Generalist Programmer at Ubisoft Massive where he works on the Uplay PC client and services. His work focuses mainly on programming with C++ but Python and C# do appear from time to time. In his spare time he plays video games which is not surprising given his job but he also likes puzzles, non fiction audio books and it would be a very strange day if it were not filled with music in some way.
